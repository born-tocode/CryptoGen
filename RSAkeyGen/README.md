#RSAkeyGen
This key generator generates 1024 - 16384 bits pair keys in RSA algorithm. 
Just run and choose one of five numbers of bits. You can choose - printing Keys only in console(copy - paste) 
or - only to files. Nice exiting from program by 'Q'. Both keys are may be opened from Notepad or another text editor.

Program was tested for all variant of key length. 

Just run JAR file in out/artifacts/RSAkeyGen_jar/ .
